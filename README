A simple blogger program mostly written in 2006. originally hosted on source forge at http://jblog.sourceforge.net/

The quick way to install this is just use ant to publish into tomcat,

<ant -Dapp.name=bob -DpublicURL=http://www.jadn.com/~bob -DpublishToDir=/home/bob/public_html -DdataDir=/home/bob/.jblog install

This assumes that your have added catalina-ant.jar to ant's classpath

-bob
